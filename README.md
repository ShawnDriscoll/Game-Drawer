Game-Drawer<br>
===========<br><br>
Scraps of game code written in Classic Python 2.5.4 and C99 for Windows XP/7.<br><br>
This has been an exercise for me in learning to use PyCharm and<br>
GitHub together.  I have since stopped using PyCharm and switched to<br>
using Eclipse, which works with Python, Jython, Java, C/C++, and Git.<br><br>
My plan is to have a folder for each programming language I make<br>
use of.  Some stuff is meant to run in Python.  Some in Jython.  Some<br>
in C for the PC.  Some in C for the TI-89.<br><br>
So far, I have dice rolling programs here.<br><br>
